== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.


== Target user profile

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

== Value proposition
 manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

[appendix]

== User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * \*`, Medium (nice to have) - `* \*`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

|Priority |As a ... |I want to ... |So that I can...
|`* * *` |new user |see usage instructions |refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App

|`* * *` |user |add a new person |

|`* * *` |user |delete a person |remove entries that I no longer need

|`* * *` |user |find a person by name |locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list

== Non Functional Requirements

.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
