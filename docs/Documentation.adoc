= ArchDuke - Documentation

We chose to use AsciiDoc to write the documentation. This is because Ascii syntax is consistent and there is a flexibility offered
for essential syntax unlike MarkDown.

== 4.1 Written documentation
The user and developer guide are written and formatted using AsciiDoc.

== 4.2 Diagrams
Diagrams are drawn and edited using the tool https://www.draw.io/[draw.io].
The tool provides support for a wide range of UML diagrams, such as class, object and sequence diagrams.
